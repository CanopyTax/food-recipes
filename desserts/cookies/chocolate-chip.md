### Cream together:
+ 1 and 1/3 cubes butter
+ 1/2 cup white sugar
+ 2/3 cup packed brown sugar

### Then add:
+ 1 egg
+ 2/3 tsp vanilla
+ 2/3 tsp salt
+ 1/2 tsp baking soda

Mix until combined, then gradually mix in:
+ 2 cups flour

Mix in chocolate chips as desired. (I usually use about half a normal sized bag.)

Bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes. Cookies will not look done, but THEY ARE I PROMISE
